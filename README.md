This is the official implementation of ***LiFT*** (DASIP 2025). LiFT is a simple, lightweight (20.73 GMAC) and fully-sparse 3D object detector.
It is tailored for (but not restricted to) real-time implementation on low-end FPGAs.
By the time of publication, it achieves the best detection performance on NuScenes-val among methods with comparable structure and complexity.

## Installation

The 
Refer to the original [OpenPCDet readme](README_openpcdet.md). 
The additional requirement in LiFT is the *Brevitas*, which can be installed with `pip install brevitas`.


## Usage

The **LiFT** is trained and validated in the same way as all the other models in the OpenPCDet repo.
Refer to the original [OpenPCDet readme](README_openpcdet.md).

## Remarks

* The implementation on FPGA is not ready yet, but it's in a progress. Updates regarding its release will be posted in this repository.
* The LiFT is quantised using the [Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas) library, as we regard it's more flexible than native PyTorch and spconv quantisation and provides more compatible interface to [FINN](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn) for future implementation on FPGA.
